Robot Framework uses and runs existing libraries (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hCegUxWKBQ).
On each library webpage there are 2 most important links: **Installation** (or project page or project on GitHub) and **Keywords**.

Example of 2 common libraries (https://robotframework.org/#resources):
- Selenium library (https://robotframework.org/SeleniumLibrary/SeleniumLibrary.html)
- Browser library (https://marketsquare.github.io/robotframework-browser/Browser.html)
